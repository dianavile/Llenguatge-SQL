# Llenguatge-SQL (Structured Query Language)

## WHAT is SQL?
- SQL is a "language" to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a "relational database".
- A  "relational database" is  collection of related (2D) tables, simular to Excel spreadsheets, with a fixed number of columns (table attributes or properties)
 and any number of rows of data.
- SQL provides a safe and scalable storage for websites and mobile applications.
- A "query" is  a statement which declares:
1) what data we are looking for, 
2) where to find it in the database, 
3) and how to transform it (before it is returned).


A table in SQL = an entity  
A Row in the table= specific instance of that type 
A Column =  common properties shared by all entities.

TABLE: DOG
ROW: puppie, huskie, labrador
COLUMN: Taillenght, Fur Color.


## HOW TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM A SQL DATABASE? 
-  write SELECT statements ("queries").
